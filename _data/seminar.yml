  abstract: Let $n,s,$ and $k$ be positive integers such that $k\geq 3$, $s\geq 3$ and $n\geq ks$. An $s$-matching $M_s$ in a $k$-uniform hypergraph is a set of $s$ pairwise disjoint edges. The anti-Ramsey number ${\rm ar}(n,k,M_s)$ of an $s$-matching  is the smallest integer $c$ such that each edge-coloring of the $n$-vertex $k$-uniform complete hypergraph with exactly $c$ colors contains an $s$-matching  with distinct colors.  The value of ${\rm ar}(n,k,M_s)$ was conjectured by \"Ozkahya and Young (Anti-Ramsey number of matchings in hypergraphs, {\it Discrete Math.}, {\bf 313} (2013), 2359--2364) for all  $n \geq sk$ and $k \geq 3$. Frankl and Kupavskii (Two problems on matchings in set families - in the footsteps of Erd\H os and Kleitman, {\em J. Combin. Theory ser. B}, \textbf{138} (2019), 286--313) verified this conjecture for all $n \geq sk+(s-1)(k-1)$ and $k \geq 3$. We aim to determine the value of ${\rm ar}(n,3,M_s)$ for $3s \leq n < 5s-2$ in this paper. Namely,  we prove that  if $3s < n < 5s-2$ and $n$ is large enough, then ${\rm ar}(n,3,M_s)={\rm ex}(n,3,M_{s-1})+2$. Here ${\rm ex}(n,3,M_{s-1})$ is the Tur\'an number of an $(s-1)$-matching. Thus this result confirms the conjecture of \"Ozkahya and Young for $k=3$, $3s<n<5s-2$ and sufficiently large $n$. For $n=ks$ and $k\geq 3$, we present a new construction for the lower bound of ${\rm ar}(n,k,M_{s})$ which shows the conjecture by \"Ozkahya and Young is not true. In particular, for $n=3s$, we prove that ${\rm ar}(n,3,M_s)={\rm ex}(n,3,M_{s-1})+5$ for sufficiently large $n$.

- title: Improved Decoding of Expander Codes
  year: 2022
  pubdate: 2022-11-8
  date: Thursday (Nov 10, 2022), 3-4 pm (offline talk)
  abstract: We study the classical expander codes, introduced by Sipser and Spielman. Given any constants $0<\alpha$, $\varepsilon<\frac{1}{2}$, and an arbitrary bipartite graph with $N$ vertices on the left, $M < N$ vertices on the right, and left degree $D$ such that any left subset $S$ of size at most $\alpha N$ has at least $(1−\varepsilon)|S|D$ neighbors, we show that the corresponding linear code given by parity checks on the right has distance at least roughly $\frac{\alpha N}{2\varepsilon}$. This is strictly better than the best known previous result of $2(1−\varepsilon)\alpha N$ whenever $\varepsilon<\frac{1}{2}$, and improves the previous result significantly when $\varepsilon$ is small. Furthermore, we show that this distance is tight in general, thus providing a complete characterization of the distance of general expander codes. <br />&nbsp;<br />Next, we provide several efficient decoding algorithms, which vastly improve previous results in terms of the fraction of errors corrected, whenever $\varepsilon<\frac{1}{4}$. Finally, we also give a bound on the list-decoding radius of general expander codes, which beats the classical Johnson bound in certain situations (e.g., when the graph is almost regular and the code has a high rate). <br />&nbsp;<br />Our techniques exploit novel combinatorial properties of bipartite expander graphs. In particular, we establish a new size-expansion tradeoff, which may be of independent interests.

- title: Embeddings in “random like” graphs
  year: 2022
  pubdate: 2022-10-26
  date: Thursday (Oct 27, 2022), 3-4 pm
  abstract: An archetype problem in extremal combinatorics is to study the structure of subgraphs appearing in different classes of (hyper)graphs. We will focus on such embedding problems in “random like” graphs. In practice, we will mention ramsey-turan problems and related results.

- title: Partition of graphs with high minimum degree
  year: 2022
  pubdate: 2022-10-13
  date: Thursday (Oct 13, 2022), 3-4 pm
  abstract: In 2003, Kuhn and Osthus showed that for every number $k$, every graph with minimum degree at least $l(k)=3\times 2^{11}\times k^2$ can be partition into none-empty sets $S$ and $T$, such that both $G[S]$ and $G[T]$ has minimum degree at least $k$, and each vertex of $S$ has at least $k$ neighbors in $T$.  We improve this result by showing that it is true for $l(k)=100k$ when $k$ is sufficiently large. This is joint work with Jie Ma from University of Science and Technology of China.

- title: Perfect Matchings in hypergraphs
  year: 2022
  pubdate: 2022-9-28
  date: Thursday (Sep 29, 2022), 3-4 pm
  abstract: Matchings are fundamental objects in the study of graph theory. Unlike in graphs, finding maximum matchings in general hypergraphs is NP-hard -- its decision problem is actually one of the Karp’s 21 NP-complete problems in 1972. Here we shall introduce some recent developments on perfect matchings in hypergraphs from both the extremal and the computational aspects in the past decade.
