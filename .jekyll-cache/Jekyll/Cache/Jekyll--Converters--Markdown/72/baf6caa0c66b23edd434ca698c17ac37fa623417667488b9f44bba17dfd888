      <p><em><strong>Abstract: </strong></em>Given a graph $G = (V,E)$ where each edge has effective resistance (treating $G$ as an electrical network where each edge is a resistor) at most $\alpha &gt; 0$, we want to partition the edges of $G$ into $E = E_1 \cup E_2$ so that both graphs $G_1 = (V,E_1)$ and $G_2 = (V,E_2)$ with doubled edge weights are $(1 +/- O(\sqrt{\alpha}))$ approximation to $G$. We say a graph $H$ is a $(1+/-\epsilon)$ approximation to another graph $G$ if the Laplacian matrix of $H$, denoted by $L_H$, and the Laplacian matrix of $G$, denoted by $L_G$, satisfies $(1-\epsilon) L_G \preceq L_H \preceq (1+\epsilon) L_G$ (the Loewner order). The proof of the Kadison-Singer problem by Marcus, Spielman, and Srivastava (Annals of Mathematics, 2015) implies the above edge partition exists, but no polynomial-time algorithms are known. We will describe a polynomial-time algorithm for a special class of circulant graphs.</p>
